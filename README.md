## attemp 1 about knockoff
Generally aligning to the outcome demonstrated in the paper, though the specific data seem to be slightly higher in my attempt, which might because of the smaller number of trials. 
* Questions: how to set the noise level according to various distributions; why knockoff+ is not that effective in my attempt; details of knockoff+'s design strategy; real application scenario to use knockoff except medical health
* Which is waiting to be tested: different models except lasso; different distribution except Gaussian where the noise belong; the real data regarding medical health provided in the paper (maybe require higher performance computers), etc.
